# Validation Report: testarch-nfr

**Validation Started:** 2026-01-27 10:24:01
**Validator:** BMAD Workflow Validation System (Codex)
**Standards Version:** BMAD Workflow Standards

## File Structure & Size

- workflow.md present: YES
- instructions.md present: YES
- workflow.yaml present: YES
- step files found: 8

**Step File Sizes:**

- steps-c/step-01-load-context.md: 77 lines [GOOD]
- steps-c/step-02-define-thresholds.md: 74 lines [GOOD]
- steps-c/step-03-gather-evidence.md: 57 lines [GOOD]
- steps-c/step-04-evaluate-and-score.md: 60 lines [GOOD]
- steps-c/step-05-generate-report.md: 63 lines [GOOD]

- steps-e/step-02-apply-edit.md: 45 lines [GOOD]
- steps-v/step-01-validate.md: 52 lines [GOOD]
- workflow-plan.md present: YES

## Frontmatter Validation

- No frontmatter violations found

## Critical Path Violations

### Config Variables (Exceptions)

Standard BMAD config variables treated as valid exceptions: bmb_creations_output_folder, communication_language, document_output_language, output_folder, planning_artifacts, project-root, project_name, test_artifacts, user_name

- No {project-root} hardcoded paths detected in body

- No dead relative links detected

- No module path assumptions detected

**Status:** ✅ PASS - No critical violations

## Menu Handling Validation

- No menu structures detected (linear step flow) [N/A]

## Step Type Validation

- steps-c/step-01-load-context.md: Init [PASS]
- steps-c/step-02-define-thresholds.md: Middle [PASS]
- steps-c/step-03-gather-evidence.md: Middle [PASS]
- steps-c/step-04-evaluate-and-score.md: Middle [PASS]
- steps-c/step-05-generate-report.md: Final [PASS]
- Step type validation assumes linear sequence (no branching/menu). Workflow-plan.md present for reference. [INFO]

## Output Format Validation

- Templates present: nfr-report-template.md
- Steps with outputFile in frontmatter:
  - steps-c/step-05-generate-report.md
  - steps-v/step-01-validate.md
- checklist.md present: YES

## Validation Design Check

- Validation steps folder (steps-v) present: YES
- Validation step(s) present: step-01-validate.md
- Validation steps reference checklist data and auto-proceed

## Instruction Style Check

- Instruction style: Prescriptive (appropriate for TEA quality/compliance workflows)
- Steps emphasize mandatory sequence, explicit success/failure metrics, and risk-based guidance

## Collaborative Experience Check

- Overall facilitation quality: GOOD
- Steps use progressive prompts and clear role reinforcement; no laundry-list interrogation detected
- Flow progression is clear and aligned to workflow goals

## Subprocess Optimization Opportunities

- No high-priority subprocess optimizations identified; workflow already uses step-file architecture
- Pattern 1 (grep/regex): N/A for most steps
- Pattern 2 (per-file analysis): already aligned to validation structure
- Pattern 3 (data ops): minimal data file loads
- Pattern 4 (parallel): optional for validation only

## Cohesive Review

- Overall assessment: GOOD
- Flow is linear, goals are clear, and outputs map to TEA artifacts
- Voice and tone consistent with Test Architect persona
- Recommendation: READY (minor refinements optional)

## Plan Quality Validation

- Plan file present: workflow-plan.md
- Planned steps found: 8 (all implemented)
- Plan implementation status: Fully Implemented

## Summary

- Validation completed: 2026-01-27 10:24:01
- Critical issues: 0
- Warnings: 0 (informational notes only)
- Readiness: READY (manual review optional)
