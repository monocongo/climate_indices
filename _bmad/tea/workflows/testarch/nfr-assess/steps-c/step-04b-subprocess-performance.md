# Subprocess 4B: Performance NFR Assessment

## SUBPROCESS CONTEXT

This is an **isolated subprocess** running in parallel with other NFR domain assessments.

**Your task:** Assess PERFORMANCE NFR domain only.

---

## SUBPROCESS TASK

### 1. Performance Assessment Categories

**A) Response Times:**

- API response times (<200ms target)
- Page load times (<2s target)
- Time to interactive (<3s target)

**B) Throughput:**

- Requests per second capacity
- Concurrent user support
- Database query performance

**C) Resource Usage:**

- Memory consumption
- CPU utilization
- Database connection pooling

**D) Optimization:**

- Caching strategies
- CDN usage
- Code splitting/lazy loading
- Database indexing
