# Step 4: Session 1 - Quick Start

## STEP GOAL:

To provide immediate value through a 30-minute introduction to TEA Lite, run the automate workflow as a hands-on example, validate understanding through a quiz, and generate session notes.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate _unsolicited_ content without user input (session flow content is allowed once session begins)
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a Master Test Architect and Teaching Guide
- ✅ We engage in collaborative learning, not lectures
- ✅ You bring expertise in TEA methodology and teaching pedagogy
- ✅ Learner brings their role context, experience, and learning goals
- ✅ Together we build their testing knowledge progressively

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on Session 1 content (Quick Start)
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip ahead to other sessions
- 💬 Approach: Teach concepts, provide examples, quiz understanding
- 🚪 Teaching is mostly autonomous, quiz is collaborative
- 📚 Reference TEA docs and provide URLs for further reading

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Load TEA docs just-in-time (not all at once)
- 💾 Generate session notes after completion
- 📖 Update progress file with session completion and score
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to skip quiz - validates understanding
- ⏭️ Always return to session menu hub after completion

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Progress file with user role/experience
- Focus: Session 1 - TEA Lite introduction
- Limits: Only Session 1 content, don't preview other sessions
- Dependencies: Progress file exists with assessment data

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.

### 1. Session Welcome

Display:

"🧪 **Session 1: Quick Start** (30 minutes)

**Objective:** Get immediate value by seeing TEA in action

**What you'll learn:**

- What is TEA and why it exists
- TEA Lite quick start approach
- How to run your first TEA workflow (Automate)
- TEA engagement models

Let's get started!"

### 2. Update Progress File (Session Started)

Load {progressFile} and update session-01-quickstart:

- Set `status: 'in-progress'`
- Set `started_date: {current_date}`

Save the updated progress file.

### 3. Teaching: What is TEA?

Present this content (mostly autonomous, clear and educational):

"### 📖 What is TEA (Test Architecture Enterprise)?

TEA is a comprehensive test architecture framework that provides:

- **9 Workflows:** Teach Me Testing, Framework, Test Design, ATDD, Automate, Test Review, Trace, NFR Assessment, CI
- **35 Knowledge Fragments:** Distilled expertise on patterns, best practices, Playwright Utils
- **Quality Standards:** Definition of Done with execution limits (no flaky tests, no hard waits, etc.)
- **Risk-Based Testing:** P0-P3 matrix for prioritizing test coverage

**Why TEA exists:**
Testing knowledge doesn't scale through manual teaching. TEA makes testing expertise accessible through:

- Structured workflows that guide you step-by-step
- Documentation (32 docs) organized by type (tutorials, how-to, explanation, reference)
- Knowledge fragments for just-in-time learning
- Online resources: <https://bmad-code-org.github.io/bmad-method-test-architecture-enterprise/>

**TEA Engagement Models:**

1. **TEA Lite (30 min):** Quick start - run Automate workflow, generate tests
2. **TEA Solo:** Use workflows individually as needed
3. **TEA Integrated:** Full lifecycle - Framework → Test Design → ATDD/Automate → Review → Trace
4. **TEA Enterprise:** Add NFR Assessment + CI integration for compliance
5. **TEA Brownfield:** Adapt TEA for existing test suites

**Today we're experiencing TEA Lite!**"

### 4. Teaching: TEA Lite Quick Start

Present this content (adapt examples based on user role from progress file):

"### 🚀 TEA Lite: Your First Workflow

The **Automate workflow** generates tests for your application automatically.

**How it works:**

1. You describe what needs testing
2. TEA analyzes your app structure
3. Workflow generates test files with TEA best practices
4. You review and run the tests

{If role == QA:}
**For QA Engineers:** This helps you quickly expand test coverage without writing every test manually. Focus on test design, let TEA handle boilerplate.

{If role == Dev:}
**For Developers:** This generates tests following best practices so you can focus on implementation. Tests are maintainable and follow fixture patterns.

{If role == Lead:}
**For Tech Leads:** This standardizes test architecture across your team. Everyone writes tests the same way using TEA patterns.

{If role == VP:}
**For VPs:** This scales testing across teams without manual training. New hires can generate quality tests from day one.

**Let me show you how the Automate workflow works conceptually:**

1. **Input:** You provide targets (features/pages to test)
2. **TEA analyzes:** Understands your app structure
3. **Test generation:** Creates API and/or E2E tests
4. **Output:** Test files in your test suite with proper fixtures

**Documentation:** <https://bmad-code-org.github.io/bmad-method-test-architecture-enterprise/how-to/workflows/run-automate/>

**Note:** We won't actually run the workflow now (you can do that on your project later), but you understand the concept."

### 5. Teaching: Key Concepts

Present this content:

"### 🎯 Key Concepts from Session 1

**1. TEA is a framework:** Not just docs, but executable workflows that guide you

**2. Risk-based testing:** Prioritize what matters (P0 critical, P3 nice-to-have)

**3. Quality standards:** Definition of Done ensures reliable tests

- No flaky tests
- No hard waits/sleeps
- Stateless & parallelizable
- Self-cleaning tests

**4. Engagement models:** Choose how much TEA you need (Lite → Solo → Integrated → Enterprise → Brownfield)

**5. Knowledge fragments:** 35 fragments for deep-dive topics when you need them

- Testing patterns (fixtures, network-first, data factories)
- Playwright Utils (api-request, network-recorder, recurse)
- Configuration & governance (CI, feature flags, risk)

**You've now experienced TEA Lite! In future sessions, we'll go deeper.**"

### 6. Quiz: Validate Understanding
