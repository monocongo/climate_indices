# Test Design and Risk Assessment - Validation Checklist

## Prerequisites (Mode-Dependent)

**System-Level Mode (Phase 3):**

- [ ] PRD exists with functional and non-functional requirements
- [ ] ADR (Architecture Decision Record) exists
- [ ] Architecture document available (architecture.md or tech-spec)
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous

**Epic-Level Mode (Phase 4):**

- [ ] Story markdown with clear acceptance criteria exists
- [ ] PRD or epic documentation available
- [ ] Architecture documents available (test-design-architecture.md + test-design-qa.md from Phase 3, if exists)
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Context Loading

- [ ] PRD.md read and requirements extracted
- [ ] Epics.md or specific epic documentation loaded
- [ ] Story markdown with acceptance criteria analyzed
- [ ] Architecture documents reviewed (if available)
- [ ] Existing test coverage analyzed
- [ ] Knowledge base fragments loaded (risk-governance, probability-impact, test-levels, test-priorities)

### Step 2: Risk Assessment

- [ ] Genuine risks identified (not just features)
- [ ] Risks classified by category (TECH/SEC/PERF/DATA/BUS/OPS)
- [ ] Probability scored (1-3 for each risk)
- [ ] Impact scored (1-3 for each risk)
- [ ] Risk scores calculated (probability × impact)
- [ ] High-priority risks (score ≥6) flagged
- [ ] Mitigation plans defined for high-priority risks
- [ ] Owners assigned for each mitigation
- [ ] Timelines set for mitigations
- [ ] Residual risk documented

### Step 3: Coverage Design

- [ ] Acceptance criteria broken into atomic scenarios
- [ ] Test levels selected (E2E/API/Component/Unit)
- [ ] No duplicate coverage across levels
- [ ] Priority levels assigned (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- [ ] P0 scenarios meet strict criteria (blocks core + high risk + no workaround)
- [ ] Data prerequisites identified
- [ ] Tooling/access requirements documented when applicable
- [ ] Execution order defined (smoke → P0 → P1 → P2/P3)

### Step 4: Deliverables Generation

- [ ] Risk assessment matrix created
- [ ] Coverage matrix created
- [ ] Execution order documented
- [ ] Resource estimates calculated
- [ ] Quality gate criteria defined
- [ ] Output file written to correct location
- [ ] Output file uses template structure

## Output Validation

### Risk Assessment Matrix

- [ ] All risks have unique IDs (R-001, R-002, etc.)
- [ ] Each risk has category assigned
- [ ] Probability values are 1, 2, or 3
- [ ] Impact values are 1, 2, or 3
- [ ] Scores calculated correctly (P × I)
- [ ] High-priority risks (≥6) clearly marked
- [ ] Mitigation strategies specific and actionable

### Coverage Matrix

- [ ] All requirements mapped to test levels
- [ ] Priorities assigned to all scenarios
- [ ] Risk linkage documented
- [ ] Test counts realistic
- [ ] Owners assigned where applicable
- [ ] No duplicate coverage (same behavior at multiple levels)

### Execution Strategy

**CRITICAL: Keep execution strategy simple, avoid redundancy**

- [ ] **Simple structure**: PR / Nightly / Weekly (NOT complex smoke/P0/P1/P2 tiers)
- [ ] **PR execution**: All functional tests unless significant infrastructure overhead
- [ ] **Nightly/Weekly**: Only performance, chaos, long-running, manual tests
- [ ] **No redundancy**: Don't re-list all tests (already in coverage plan)
- [ ] **Philosophy stated**: "Run everything in PRs if <15 min, defer only if expensive/long"
- [ ] **Playwright parallelization noted**: 100s of tests in 10-15 min

### Resource Estimates

**CRITICAL: Use intervals/ranges, NOT exact numbers**

- [ ] P0 effort provided as interval range (e.g., "~25-40 hours" NOT "36 hours")
- [ ] P1 effort provided as interval range (e.g., "~20-35 hours" NOT "27 hours")
- [ ] P2 effort provided as interval range (e.g., "~10-30 hours" NOT "15.5 hours")
- [ ] P3 effort provided as interval range (e.g., "~2-5 hours" NOT "2.5 hours")
- [ ] Total effort provided as interval range (e.g., "~55-110 hours" NOT "81 hours")
- [ ] Timeline provided as week range (e.g., "~1.5-3 weeks" NOT "11 days")
- [ ] Estimates include setup time and account for complexity variations
- [ ] **No false precision**: Avoid exact calculations like "18 tests × 2 hours = 36 hours"

### Quality Gate Criteria

- [ ] P0 pass rate threshold defined (should be 100%)
- [ ] P1 pass rate threshold defined (typically ≥95%)
- [ ] High-risk mitigation completion required
- [ ] Coverage targets specified (≥80% recommended)

## Quality Checks

### Evidence-Based Assessment

- [ ] Risk assessment based on documented evidence
- [ ] No speculation on business impact
- [ ] Assumptions clearly documented
- [ ] Clarifications requested where needed
- [ ] Historical data referenced where available

### Risk Classification Accuracy

- [ ] TECH risks are architecture/integration issues
- [ ] SEC risks are security vulnerabilities
- [ ] PERF risks are performance/scalability concerns
- [ ] DATA risks are data integrity issues
- [ ] BUS risks are business/revenue impacts
- [ ] OPS risks are deployment/operational issues

### Priority Assignment Accuracy

**CRITICAL: Priority classification is separate from execution timing**

- [ ] **Priority sections (P0/P1/P2/P3) do NOT include execution context** (e.g., no "Run on every commit" in headers)
- [ ] **Priority sections have only "Criteria" and "Purpose"** (no "Execution:" field)
- [ ] **Execution Strategy section** is separate and handles timing based on infrastructure overhead
- [ ] P0: Truly blocks core functionality + High-risk (≥6) + No workaround
- [ ] P1: Important features + Medium-risk (3-4) + Common workflows
- [ ] P2: Secondary features + Low-risk (1-2) + Edge cases
- [ ] P3: Nice-to-have + Exploratory + Benchmarks
- [ ] **Note at top of Test Coverage Plan**: Clarifies P0/P1/P2/P3 = priority/risk, NOT execution timing

### Test Level Selection

- [ ] E2E used only for critical paths
- [ ] API tests cover complex business logic
- [ ] Component tests for UI interactions
- [ ] Unit tests for edge cases and algorithms
- [ ] No redundant coverage

## Integration Points

### Knowledge Base Integration

- [ ] probability-impact.md applied
- [ ] test-levels-framework.md referenced
- [ ] test-priorities-matrix.md used
- [ ] Additional fragments loaded as needed

### Status File Integration

- [ ] Epic number and scope documented
- [ ] Completion timestamp recorded

### Workflow Dependencies

- [ ] Can proceed to `*atdd` workflow with P0 scenarios
- [ ] `*atdd` is a separate workflow and must be run explicitly (not auto-run)
- [ ] Can proceed to `automate` workflow with full coverage plan
- [ ] Risk assessment informs `gate` workflow criteria
- [ ] Integrates with `ci` workflow execution order

- [ ] **Clear separation**: Architecture = WHAT and WHY, QA = HOW
- [ ] **Professional tone**: No AI slop markers
  - [ ] Avoid excessive ✅/❌ emojis (use sparingly, only when adding clarity)
  - [ ] Avoid "absolutely", "excellent", "fantastic", overly enthusiastic language
  - [ ] Write professionally and directly
- [ ] **Architecture doc length**: Target ~150-200 lines max (focus on actionable concerns only)
- [ ] **QA doc length**: Keep concise, remove bloat sections

### Architecture Doc Structure (Actionable-First Principle)

**CRITICAL: Validate structure follows actionable-first, FYI-last principle**

- [ ] **Actionable sections at TOP:**
  - [ ] Quick Guide (🚨 BLOCKERS first, then ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY, then 📋 INFO ONLY last)
  - [ ] Risk Assessment (high-priority risks ≥6 at top)
  - [ ] Testability Concerns (concerns/blockers at top, passing items at bottom)
  - [ ] Risk Mitigation Plans (for high-priority risks ≥6)
- [ ] **FYI sections at BOTTOM:**
  - [ ] Testability Assessment Summary (what works well - only if worth mentioning)
  - [ ] Assumptions and Dependencies
- [ ] **ASRs categorized correctly:**
  - [ ] Actionable ASRs included in 🚨 or ⚠️ sections
  - [ ] FYI ASRs included in 📋 section or omitted if obvious

## Completion Criteria

**All must be true:**

- [ ] All prerequisites met
- [ ] All process steps completed
- [ ] All output validations passed
- [ ] All quality checks passed
- [ ] All integration points verified
- [ ] Output file(s) complete and well-formatted
- [ ] **System-level mode:** Both documents validated (if applicable)
- [ ] **Epic-level mode:** Single document validated (if applicable)
- [ ] Team review scheduled (if required)

## Post-Workflow Actions

**User must complete:**

1. [ ] Review risk assessment with team
2. [ ] Prioritize mitigation for high-priority risks (score ≥6)

4. [ ] Run `*atdd` workflow to generate P0 tests (separate workflow; not auto-run)
5. [ ] Set up test data factories and fixtures
6. [ ] Schedule team review of test design document

**Recommended next workflows:**

1. [ ] Run `atdd` workflow for P0 test generation
2. [ ] Run `framework` workflow if not already done
3. [ ] Run `ci` workflow to configure pipeline stages

## Rollback Procedure

If workflow fails:

1. [ ] Delete output file
2. [ ] Review error logs
3. [ ] Fix missing context (PRD, architecture docs)
4. [ ] Clarify ambiguous requirements
5. [ ] Retry workflow

## Notes

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Too many P0 tests

- **Solution**: Apply strict P0 criteria - must block core AND high risk AND no workaround

**Issue**: Risk scores all high

- **Solution**: Differentiate between high-impact (3) and degraded (2) impacts

**Issue**: Duplicate coverage across levels

- **Solution**: Use test pyramid - E2E for critical paths only

**Issue**: Resource estimates too high or too precise

- **Solution**:
  - Invest in fixtures/factories to reduce per-test setup time
  - Use interval ranges (e.g., "~55-110 hours") instead of exact numbers (e.g., "81 hours")
  - Widen intervals if high uncertainty exists

**Issue**: Execution order section too complex or redundant

- **Solution**:
  - Default: Run everything in PRs (<15 min with Playwright parallelization)
  - Only defer to nightly/weekly if expensive (k6, chaos, 4+ hour tests)
  - Don't create smoke/P0/P1/P2/P3 tier structure
  - Don't re-list all tests (already in coverage plan)

### Best Practices

- Base risk assessment on evidence, not assumptions
- High-priority risks (≥6) require immediate mitigation
- P0 tests should cover <10% of total scenarios
- Avoid testing same behavior at multiple levels
- **Use interval-based estimates** (e.g., "~25-40 hours") instead of exact numbers to avoid false precision and provide flexibility
- **Keep execution strategy simple**: Default to "run everything in PRs" (<15 min with Playwright), only defer if expensive/long-running
- **Avoid execution order redundancy**: Don't create complex tier structures or re-list tests
