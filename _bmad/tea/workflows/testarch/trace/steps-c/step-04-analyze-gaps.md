# Step 4: Complete Phase 1 - Coverage Matrix Generation

## STEP GOAL

**Phase 1 Final Step:** Analyze coverage gaps, generate recommendations, and output complete coverage matrix to temp file for Phase 2 (gate decision).

---

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`
- ✅ Output coverage matrix to temp file
- ❌ Do NOT make gate decision (that's Phase 2 - Step 5)

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: requirements from Step 1, tests from Step 2, traceability matrix from Step 3
- Focus: gap analysis and matrix completion
- Limits: do not make gate decision (Phase 2 responsibility)

---

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Gap Analysis

**Identify uncovered requirements:**

```javascript
const uncoveredRequirements = traceabilityMatrix.filter((req) => req.coverage === 'NONE');
const partialCoverage = traceabilityMatrix.filter((req) => req.coverage === 'PARTIAL');
const unitOnlyCoverage = traceabilityMatrix.filter((req) => req.coverage === 'UNIT-ONLY');
```

**Prioritize gaps by risk:**

```javascript
const criticalGaps = uncoveredRequirements.filter((req) => req.priority === 'P0');
const highGaps = uncoveredRequirements.filter((req) => req.priority === 'P1');
const mediumGaps = uncoveredRequirements.filter((req) => req.priority === 'P2');
const lowGaps = uncoveredRequirements.filter((req) => req.priority === 'P3');
```

---

### 2. Generate Recommendations

**Based on gap analysis:**

```javascript
const recommendations = [];

// Critical gaps (P0)
if (criticalGaps.length > 0) {
  recommendations.push({
    priority: 'URGENT',
    action: `Run /bmad:tea:atdd for ${criticalGaps.length} P0 requirements`,
    requirements: criticalGaps.map((r) => r.id),
  });
}

// High priority gaps (P1)
if (highGaps.length > 0) {
  recommendations.push({
    priority: 'HIGH',
    action: `Run /bmad:tea:automate to expand coverage for ${highGaps.length} P1 requirements`,
    requirements: highGaps.map((r) => r.id),
  });
}

// Partial coverage
if (partialCoverage.length > 0) {
  recommendations.push({
    priority: 'MEDIUM',
    action: `Complete coverage for ${partialCoverage.length} partially covered requirements`,
    requirements: partialCoverage.map((r) => r.id),
  });
}

// Quality issues
recommendations.push({
  priority: 'LOW',
  action: 'Run /bmad:tea:test-review to assess test quality',
  requirements: [],
});
```

---

### 3. Calculate Coverage Statistics

```javascript
const totalRequirements = traceabilityMatrix.length;
const coveredRequirements = traceabilityMatrix.filter((r) => r.coverage === 'FULL' || r.coverage === 'PARTIAL').length;
const fullyCovered = traceabilityMatrix.filter((r) => r.coverage === 'FULL').length;

const coveragePercentage = Math.round((fullyCovered / totalRequirements) * 100);

// Priority-specific coverage
const p0Total = traceabilityMatrix.filter((r) => r.priority === 'P0').length;
const p0Covered = traceabilityMatrix.filter((r) => r.priority === 'P0' && r.coverage === 'FULL').length;
const p0CoveragePercentage = Math.round((p0Covered / p0Total) * 100);
```

---

### 4. Generate Complete Coverage Matrix

**Compile all Phase 1 outputs:**

```javascript
const coverageMatrix = {
  phase: 'PHASE_1_COMPLETE',
  generated_at: new Date().toISOString(),

  requirements: traceabilityMatrix, // Full matrix from Step 3

  coverage_statistics: {
    total_requirements: totalRequirements,
    fully_covered: fullyCovered,
    partially_covered: partialCoverage.length,
    uncovered: uncoveredRequirements.length,
    overall_coverage_percentage: coveragePercentage,

    priority_breakdown: {
      P0: { total: p0Total, covered: p0Covered, percentage: p0CoveragePercentage },
      P1: {
        /* calculate */
      },
      P2: {
        /* calculate */
      },
      P3: {
        /* calculate */
      },
    },
  },

  gap_analysis: {
    critical_gaps: criticalGaps,
    high_gaps: highGaps,
    medium_gaps: mediumGaps,
    low_gaps: lowGaps,
    partial_coverage_items: partialCoverage,
    unit_only_items: unitOnlyCoverage,
  },

  recommendations: recommendations,
};
```

---

### 5. Output Coverage Matrix to Temp File

**Write to temp file for Phase 2:**

```javascript
const outputPath = '{tempOutputFile}';
fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify(coverageMatrix, null, 2), 'utf8');

console.log(`✅ Phase 1 Complete: Coverage matrix saved to ${outputPath}`);
```

---

### 6. Display Phase 1 Summary

```
✅ Phase 1 Complete: Coverage Matrix Generated

📊 Coverage Statistics:
- Total Requirements: {totalRequirements}
- Fully Covered: {fullyCovered} ({coveragePercentage}%)
- Partially Covered: {partialCoverage.length}
- Uncovered: {uncoveredRequirements.length}

🎯 Priority Coverage:
- P0: {p0Covered}/{p0Total} ({p0CoveragePercentage}%)
- P1: {p1Coverage}%
- P2: {p2Coverage}%
- P3: {p3Coverage}%

⚠️ Gaps Identified:
- Critical (P0): {criticalGaps.length}
- High (P1): {highGaps.length}
- Medium (P2): {mediumGaps.length}
- Low (P3): {lowGaps.length}

📝 Recommendations: {recommendations.length}

🔄 Phase 2: Gate decision (next step)
```

---

## EXIT CONDITION

**PHASE 1 COMPLETE when:**

- ✅ Gap analysis complete
- ✅ Recommendations generated
- ✅ Coverage statistics calculated
- ✅ Coverage matrix saved to temp file
- ✅ Summary displayed

**Proceed to Phase 2 (Step 5: Gate Decision)**

---

### 7. Save Progress

**Save this step's accumulated work to `{outputFile}`.**

- **If `{outputFile}` does not exist** (first save), create it using the workflow template (if available) with YAML frontmatter:

  ```yaml
  ---
  stepsCompleted: ['step-04-analyze-gaps']
  lastStep: 'step-04-analyze-gaps'
  lastSaved: '{date}'
  ---
  ```

  Then write this step's output below the frontmatter.

- **If `{outputFile}` already exists**, update:
  - Add `'step-04-analyze-gaps'` to `stepsCompleted` array (only if not already present)
  - Set `lastStep: 'step-04-analyze-gaps'`
  - Set `lastSaved: '{date}'`
  - Append this step's output to the appropriate section of the document.

Load next step: `{nextStepFile}`

---

## 🚨 PHASE 1 SUCCESS METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Coverage matrix complete and accurate
- All gaps identified and prioritized
- Recommendations actionable
- Temp file output valid JSON

### ❌ FAILURE:

- Coverage matrix incomplete
- Gap analysis missing
- Invalid JSON output

**Master Rule:** Phase 1 MUST output complete coverage matrix to temp file before Phase 2 can proceed.
