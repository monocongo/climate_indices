# Subprocess 3E: Performance Quality Check

## SUBPROCESS CONTEXT

This is an **isolated subprocess** running in parallel with other quality dimension checks.

**Your task:** Analyze test files for PERFORMANCE violations only.

---

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- ✅ Check PERFORMANCE only (not other quality dimensions)
- ✅ Output structured JSON to temp file
- ❌ Do NOT check determinism, isolation, maintainability, or coverage

---

## SUBPROCESS TASK

### 1. Identify Performance Violations

**HIGH SEVERITY Violations**:

- Tests not parallelizable (using test.describe.serial unnecessarily)
- Slow setup/teardown (creating fresh DB for every test)
- Excessive navigation (reloading pages unnecessarily)
- No fixture reuse (repeating expensive operations)

**MEDIUM SEVERITY Violations**:

- Hard waits >2 seconds (waitForTimeout(5000))
- Inefficient selectors (page.$$ instead of locators)
- Large data sets in tests without pagination
- Missing performance optimizations

**LOW SEVERITY Violations**:

- Could use parallelization (test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' }))
- Minor inefficiencies
- Excessive logging

### 2. Calculate Performance Score

```javascript
const severityWeights = { HIGH: 10, MEDIUM: 5, LOW: 2 };
const totalPenalty = violations.reduce((sum, v) => sum + severityWeights[v.severity], 0);
const score = Math.max(0, 100 - totalPenalty);
```
