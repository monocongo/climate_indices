# Subprocess 3C: Maintainability Quality Check

## SUBPROCESS CONTEXT

This is an **isolated subprocess** running in parallel with other quality dimension checks.

**Your task:** Analyze test files for MAINTAINABILITY violations only.

---

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- ✅ Check MAINTAINABILITY only (not other quality dimensions)
- ✅ Output structured JSON to temp file
- ❌ Do NOT check determinism, isolation, coverage, or performance

---

## SUBPROCESS TASK

### 1. Identify Maintainability Violations

**HIGH SEVERITY Violations**:

- Tests >100 lines (too complex)
- No test.describe grouping
- Duplicate test logic (copy-paste)
- Unclear test names (no Given/When/Then structure)
- Magic numbers/strings without constants

**MEDIUM SEVERITY Violations**:

- Tests missing comments for complex logic
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Excessive nesting (>3 levels)
- Large setup/teardown blocks

**LOW SEVERITY Violations**:

- Minor code style issues
- Could benefit from helper functions
- Inconsistent assertion styles

### 2. Calculate Maintainability Score

```javascript
const severityWeights = { HIGH: 10, MEDIUM: 5, LOW: 2 };
const totalPenalty = violations.reduce((sum, v) => sum + severityWeights[v.severity], 0);
const score = Math.max(0, 100 - totalPenalty);
```
