# Subprocess 3D: Coverage Quality Check

## SUBPROCESS CONTEXT

This is an **isolated subprocess** running in parallel with other quality dimension checks.

**Your task:** Analyze test files for COVERAGE violations only.

---

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- ✅ Check COVERAGE only (not other quality dimensions)
- ✅ Output structured JSON to temp file
- ❌ Do NOT check determinism, isolation, maintainability, or performance

---

## SUBPROCESS TASK

### 1. Identify Coverage Violations

**HIGH SEVERITY Violations**:

- Critical user paths not tested (P0 functionality missing)
- API endpoints without tests
- Error handling not tested (no negative test cases)
- Missing authentication/authorization tests

**MEDIUM SEVERITY Violations**:

- Edge cases not covered (boundary values, null/empty inputs)
- Only happy path tested (no error scenarios)
- Missing integration tests (only unit or only E2E)
- Insufficient assertion coverage (tests don't verify important outcomes)

**LOW SEVERITY Violations**:

- Could benefit from additional test cases
- Minor edge cases not covered
- Documentation incomplete

### 2. Calculate Coverage Score

```javascript
const criticalGaps = violations.filter((v) => v.severity === 'HIGH').length;
const score = criticalGaps === 0 ? Math.max(0, 100 - violations.length * 5) : Math.max(0, 50 - criticalGaps * 10); // Heavy penalty for critical gaps
```
