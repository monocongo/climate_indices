# Subprocess 3B: Isolation Quality Check

## SUBPROCESS CONTEXT

This is an **isolated subprocess** running in parallel with other quality dimension checks.

**Your task:** Analyze test files for ISOLATION violations only.

---

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- ✅ Check ISOLATION only (not other quality dimensions)
- ✅ Output structured JSON to temp file
- ❌ Do NOT check determinism, maintainability, coverage, or performance
- ❌ Do NOT modify test files (read-only analysis)

---

## SUBPROCESS TASK

### 1. Identify Isolation Violations

**Scan test files for isolation issues:**

**HIGH SEVERITY Violations**:

- Global state mutations (global variables modified)
- Test order dependencies (test B depends on test A running first)
- Shared database records without cleanup
- beforeAll/afterAll with side effects leaking to other tests

**MEDIUM SEVERITY Violations**:

- Missing test cleanup (created data not deleted)
- Shared fixtures that mutate state
- Tests that assume specific execution order
- Environment variables modified without restoration

**LOW SEVERITY Violations**:

- Tests sharing test data (but not mutating)
- Missing test.describe grouping
- Tests that could be more isolated

### 2. Calculate Isolation Score

```javascript
const totalChecks = testFiles.length * checksPerFile;
const failedChecks = violations.length;
const severityWeights = { HIGH: 10, MEDIUM: 5, LOW: 2 };
const totalPenalty = violations.reduce((sum, v) => sum + severityWeights[v.severity], 0);
const score = Math.max(0, 100 - totalPenalty);
```

## EXIT CONDITION

Subprocess completes when:

- ✅ All test files analyzed for isolation violations
- ✅ Score calculated
- ✅ JSON output written to temp file

**Subprocess terminates here.**

---

## 🚨 SUBPROCESS SUCCESS METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Only isolation checked (not other dimensions)
- JSON output valid and complete

### ❌ FAILURE:

- Checked quality dimensions other than isolation
- Invalid or missing JSON output
