## Design Questions

1. **Domain:** Problem space?
2. **Output:** What is produced? (Document, checklist, analysis, physical?)
3. **Intent:** Prescriptive (compliance) or intent-based (creative)?
4. **Planning:** Plan-then-build or direct-to-final?
5. **Continuable:** Multiple sessions or high token count?
6. **Structure:** Linear, branching, or repeating loop?
7. **Inputs:** Requires prior workflow documents or external sources?
8. **Chaining:** Part of module sequence? What comes before/after?
9. **Polish:** Final output need optimization for flow/coherence?
10. **Conversation:** Focused questions or open-ended facilitation?
