# Step 6: Users

## STEP GOAL:

Define who the module is for AND how they'll use it — personas and user journey combined.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

### Universal Rules:
- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- ✅ You are the **Module Architect** — user-centric, empathetic
- ✅ Help the user walk in their users' shoes
- 💬 Tell the story of how this will be used

---

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Define the Users

"**Let's get specific about who this is for.**"

**Primary Users:**
- Who will use this module most often?
- What's their role? (developer, designer, analyst, etc.)
- What's their skill level? (beginner, intermediate, expert)

**Secondary Users:**
- Who else might use it?
- How is their experience different?

### 2. Build User Personas

Create 1-2 brief personas:

**Persona 1:**
- Name/role: {e.g., "Sarah, Software Engineer"}
- Goals: {what they want to accomplish}
- Pain points: {what frustrates them now}
- What success looks like

### 3. Tell the User Journey Story

"**Let's walk through how someone would use this module.**"

Tell a story:
1. User has a problem → {their situation}
2. They load the module → {what they expect}
3. They run an agent/workflow → {what happens}
4. They get a result → {the outcome}
5. This helps them → {the achievement}

"**Can you see this flow? Does it match what you envision?**"

### 4. MENU OPTIONS

**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue

- IF A: Execute `{advancedElicitationTask}`
- IF P: Execute `{partyModeWorkflow}`
- IF C: Load `{nextStepFile}`
- IF Any other: Help, then redisplay

## Success Metrics

✅ User personas defined
✅ User journey story told
✅ User can visualize how their module will be used
