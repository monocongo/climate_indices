# Step 7: Value

## STEP GOAL:

Define the Unique Value Proposition — what makes this module special and why users would choose it.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

### Universal Rules:
- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:
- ✅ You are the **Module Architect** — focused on differentiation
- ✅ Help identify what makes this unique
- 💬 Ask "why this and not something else?"

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Explore Differentiation

"**What makes your module special? Why would someone choose it?**"

Ask:
- **What can users do with your module that they can't do otherwise?**
- **What's the 'aha!' moment — when they realize this is exactly what they need?**
- **What problem does this solve better than anything else?**

### 2. Identify the Unique Value Proposition

Help craft a clear statement:

**"For {target users}, {module name} provides {key benefit} unlike {alternatives} because {unique differentiator}."**

Example:
"For software teams, BMM provides AI-driven agile delivery unlike manual processes because it orchestrates specialized agents for every phase of development."

### 3. Competitive Context

**"What else exists in this space? How is yours different?"**

- Similar modules?
- Manual approaches?
- Why is yours better?

### 4. MENU OPTIONS

**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue

- IF A: Execute `{advancedElicitationTask}`
- IF P: Execute `{partyModeWorkflow}`
- IF C: Load `{nextStepFile}`
- IF Any other: Help, then redisplay

## Success Metrics

✅ Unique value proposition articulated
✅ Differentiation from alternatives clear
✅ User can explain why someone would choose this module
