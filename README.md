# Climate Indices in Python

This project contains Python implementations of various climate index algorithms which provide 
a geographical and temporal picture of the severity of precipitation and temperature anomalies.

We attempt to provide best-of-breed implementations of various climate indices commonly used
for climate monitoring, to provide a codebase that is available for development by 
the climate science community, and to facilitate the use of climate indices datasets computed 
in a standardized, reproducible, and transparent fashion.

Python implementations of the following climate index algorithms are provided:

-  [SPI](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/standardized-precipitation-index-spi),
   Standardized Precipitation Index, utilizing either Gamma or Pearson Type III distributions
-  [SPEI](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252361460_The_Standardized_Precipitation-Evapotranspiration_Index_SPEI_a_multiscalar_drought_index),
   Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, utilizing either Gamma or Pearson Type III distributions
-  [PET](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/dyk/potential-evapotranspiration),
   Potential Evapotranspiration, utilizing either [Thornthwaite](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/21073)
   or [Hargreaves](http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.26773) equations 
-  [PNP](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/percent-of-normal-precipitation/),
   Percentage of Normal Precipitation
-  [PDSI](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/palmer-drought-severity-index-pdsi/),
   Palmer Drought Severity Index
-  [scPDSI](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/self-calibrated-palmer-drought-severity-index-sc-pdsi/),
   Self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index
-  [PHDI](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/palmer-hydrological-drought-index-phdi/),
   Palmer Hydrological Drought Index
-  [Z-Index](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/palmer-z-index/),
   Palmer moisture anomaly index (Z-index)
-  [PMDI](https://climate.ncsu.edu/climate/climdiv), Palmer Modified
   Drought Index

This Python implementation of the above climate index algorithms is
being developed with the following goals in mind:

-  to provide an open source software package for the computation of a suite of
   indices commonly used for climate monitoring, with well
   documented code that is faithful to the relevant literature and
   which produces scientifically valid results
-  to facilitate standardization and consensus on best-of-breed implementations
   of climate index algorithms 
-  to provide transparency into the operational code used for climate
   monitoring activities at NCEI, and independent reproducibility for users of
   climate index datasets provided by NCEI/NOAA
-  to serve as an example of open source scientific development
   incorporating software engineering principles and programming best
   practices


This is a developmental/forked version of code that is originally developed and maintained by NIDIS/NCEI/NOAA. The official release version is available at [drought.gov](drought.gov).
