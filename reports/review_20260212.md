# Review Findings - 2026-02-12

## Scope
Reviewed recent hardening-related changes on `master`, focusing on:
- `6879e0c` (PR #609 merge: dependency/security hardening)
- `011977f` (security dependency group follow-up)
- Resulting current `master` workflow and dependency config state

## Findings (Ordered by Severity)

1. **Medium: Security audit job currently audits dev/docs/test stack, not just releasable dependencies**
- **Where**: `.github/workflows/release.yml:67`, `.github/workflows/unit-tests-workflow.yml:125`
- **What**: Both jobs run `uv sync --frozen --group security` without `--no-dev`.
- **Why this is a problem**: In `uv`, the `dev` group is enabled by default unless explicitly disabled. This means the audit environment includes large dev-only dependency surface (e.g., docs/jupyter/test tooling), which can:
  - block releases/merges on vulnerabilities in non-runtime tooling,
  - increase audit noise and reduce signal,
  - slow down CI materially.
- **Evidence observed**: A dry run in a clean environment pulled the full dev stack (189 packages, including `jupyter`, `sphinx`, `pytest`, etc.), not a minimal runtime+audit set.
- **Recommendation**: Change both jobs to `uv sync --frozen --no-dev --group security` (or equivalent explicit group selection) to keep audit scope aligned with release/runtime risk.

2. **Medium: Security audit coverage is limited to Python 3.12 only**
- **Where**: `.github/workflows/release.yml:61`, `.github/workflows/unit-tests-workflow.yml:119`, supported versions in `pyproject.toml:19`, `pyproject.toml:20`, `pyproject.toml:21`, `pyproject.toml:22`, `pyproject.toml:26`
- **What**: Security audit jobs are pinned to Python `3.12`, while project support range is `>=3.10,<3.14`.
- **Why this is a problem**: Dependency resolution and vulnerability exposure can differ by Python version/markers. Auditing only 3.12 can miss CVEs reachable on 3.10/3.11/3.13 install sets.
- **Recommendation**: Run security audit in a small version matrix at least for oldest+latest supported versions (`3.10` and `3.13`), or full support matrix if CI budget allows.

## Notes
No additional high-severity runtime code regressions were identified in the reviewed hardening diffs.
