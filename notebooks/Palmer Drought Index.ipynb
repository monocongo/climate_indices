    "# Palmer Drought Indices\n",
    "The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) was devised ([Palmer, 1965](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/drought/docs/palmer.pdf)) to represent the severity of dry and wet spells over the U.S. based on monthly temperature and precipitation data as well as the soil-water holding capacity at that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDSI has been run operationally by NCEI (previously NCDC) utilizing legacy Fortran code that was written by several contributors (Guttman, Heim, Karl, Wallis) circa 1980s-90s. Documented below is an effort to rejuvenate this code in a Python implementation. Motivations for this reimplementation/rejuvenation effort:\n",
    "1. Python is more widely used and readable by more potential users, allowing for more transparent operations and more inclusive development\n",
    "2. Python is more easily executed on all foreseeable platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac)\n",
    "3. Free, open source distribution available for all use (public domain), with encouragement of contributions via git repository pull requests, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm for computing empirical constants for the climatic characteristic and duration factors is also implemented to provide a self-calibrated PDSI (based on Wells, 2004 http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2004)017%3C2335:ASPDSI%3E2.0.CO;2)).\n",

    "## Review of Palmer algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Palmer algorithm begins with a two layer water balance accounting for a location, which produces both actual and potential values related to the soil moisture: evapotranspiration (ET), recharge (R), runoff (RO), loss (L), potential evapotranspiration (PE), potential recharge (PR), potential runoff (PRO), and potential loss (PL). The potential evapotranspiration is computed via the Thornthwaite method which requires only temperature and latitude as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The soil moisture values determined from the water balance accounting are then used to compute the climatologically appropriate for existing conditions (CAFEC) coefficients, which are then used to compute a weighting factor, or climatic characteristic (K), for the location. The CAFEC precipitation, or amount that is the amount of precipitation needed to maintain a normal soil moisture level for a single month (Wells et al 2004, p 2336), is then computed using the water balance and CAFEC coefficients. The moisture departure value (d) is the difference between the observed precipitation and the CAFEC precipitation amounts, and then the Z-Index, the first of Palmer's original drought indices, is computed by applying the climatic characteristic as a weighting factor to the moisture departure. The Z-Index is then used to determine the probability that a dry or wet spell is underway, being established, or in abatement, and based upon this index values are computed using empirically derived duration factors, and selected via a backstepping process. \n",

    "From Wells 2004:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each month of every year, four values related to the soil moisture are computed along with their complementary potential values. These eight values are evapotranspiration (ET), recharge (R), runoff (RO), loss (L), potential evapotranspiration (PE), potential recharge (PR), potential runoff (PRO), and potential loss (PL). The potential evapotranspiration is estimated using Thornthwaite's method (Thornthwaite 1948). The calculation of these values depends heavily on the available water holding capacity (AWC) of the soil. The PDSI itself depends on a two-stage “bucket” model of the soil. The top layer of soil is assumed to hold one inch of moisture. The amount of moisture that can be held by the rest of the underlying soil (AWC) is a location-dependent value, which must be provided as an input parameter to the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four potential values are weighted according to the climate of the area using α, β, γ, and δ to give the climatically appropriate for existing conditions (CAFEC) potential values. The weighting factors α, β, γ, and δ are called the water-balance coefficients and are found in the following manner:\n",

    "$\\large \\bar{L_1}$ = $\\large \\sum _{i=1}^{number of years of data} L_1 \\over number of years of data$\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAFEC potential values are combined to form the CAFEC precipitation, P̂, which represents the amount of precipitation needed to maintain a normal soil moisture level for a single month:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\hat{P} = (\\alpha_i \\times PE) + (\\beta_i \\times PR) + (\\gamma_i \\times PRO) + (\\delta_i \\times PL)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the actual precipitation that fell in a specific month and the computed CAFEC precipitation is the moisture departure, denoted d:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large d = P - \\hat{P}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The moisture departure, $d$, is the excess or shortage of precipitation compared to the CAFEC precipitation. Of course, the same $d$ will mean different things at different times, as well as at different locations. This prevents straightforward comparisons from being made between different values of $d$. To correct for this, the moisture departure is weighted using $K$, which is called the climatic characteristic. Here $K$ is actually a refinement of $K′$, which is Palmer's general approximation for the climate characteristic of a location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of 17.67 in Palmer's original equation for $K$ is an empirical constant derived using data from nine different locations in seven states (Palmer 1965). The purpose of the climatic characteristic, $K$, is to adjust the value of $d$ according to the characteristics of the climate in such a way as to allow for accurate comparisons of PDSI values over time and space. This value is replaced in the self-calibrated computation\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of multiplying the moisture departure, $d$, by $K$ is called the moisture anomaly index, or the Z index, and is denoted by $Z$, shown as\n",
    "\n",
    "$Z = dK$ (Wells 2004, Eq. 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z index can be used to show how wet or dry it was during a single month without regard to recent precipitation trends. The Z index is used to calculate the PDSI value for a given month using the general formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_i = 0.897X_{i - 1} + \\large\\frac{Z_i}{3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to calculate the current value of Xi, 0.897 times the previous PDSI value Xi−1 is added to one-third of the current moisture anomaly Zi. Palmer called the values 0.897 and 1/3 the duration factors. They were empirically derived by Palmer from two locations (western Kansas and central Iowa) and affect the sensitivity of the index to precipitation events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three PDSI values are actually computed each month: X1, X2, and X3. The values of X1 and X2 are the severity of a wet or dry spell, respectively, that might become established. A spell becomes established when it reaches the threshold of ±0.5. This threshold follows from the fact that index values between −0.5 and 0.5 are regarded as “normal” values; X3 is the severity of a wet or dry spell that is currently established. If there is no established spell, the PDSI value is set to either X1 or X2, according to which spell is most likely to become established. This is determined by which index is closer to the threshold of an established spell, which is simply the index with a larger absolute value. If there is a current spell established, that is, when X3 is not zero, the PDSI value for that month is X3. However, when the index is calculated at a later date, it may be discovered that the current spell actually ended earlier. In this case, the PDSI values will be replaced by values of either X1 or X2. This replacement of previously calculated PDSI values will be referred to as backtracking. Exactly how backtracking works, and what factors set it off are beyond the scope of this study. However, the existence of backtracking means that a small change in how the indices are computed may cause backtracking, which has a substantial effect on the final values of the index.\n",

    "#TODO validate and clarify the below with the guidance of Richard Heim et al\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Compute PET using Thornthwaite method (can be substituted with PET derived from Penman-Monteith, if available)\n",
    "1. Perform a monthly hydrological accounting involving five parameters: precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture loss and recharge, and runoff. Both potential and actual values are computed for all the above except precipitation. Means of the potential and actual values for these parameters are computed over a calibration period that is usually, but not necessarily, the data period of record.\n",
    "2. Utilizing the above water balance values we compute corresponding coefficients which are then used to compute the \"CAFEC\" precipitation, i.e. the amount of precipitation required for normal water balance during each month.\n",
    "3. Calculate the moisture departure (precipitation minus CAFEC precipitation)\n",
    "4. Compute Z-Index, or moisture anomaly index, from the moisture departure and a separately computed \"climatic characteristic\"\n",
    "5. Compute the intermediate values X1, X2 (the severity of a wet or dry spell, respectively), and X3 (the severity of a wet or dry spell that is currently established) values for each month, as well as the probability that an established drought or wet spell has ended\n",
    "6. Selection of X1, X2, or X3 as final PDSI value, based in part on \"backtracking\"\n",
    "7. Calibrate for self-calibrated PDSI: replace the empirically derived climatic characteristic (K) and duration factors (0.897 and 1/3) with values calculated from the historical climatic data of a location\n",
    "8. Recompute PDSI (scPDSI) using the location calibrated climatic characteristic and duration factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Described below is a Python implementation of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Index (scPDSI) which attempts to apply the above algorithm to a time series of monthly climatological values (temperature, precipitation, and soil water capacity). This is presented as a reference implementation of PDSI/scPDSI that produces scientifically valid results, is faithful to the original research/literature, and is easily acessible via an open source repository.\n",

    "In order to provide greater spatial and seasonal standardization to the PDSI to increase the spatial comparability (Wells and Goddard, 2004 https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2004)017%3C2335:ASPDSI%3E2.0.CO;2). This is achieved by dynamically computing the climatic characteristic and the duration factors, rather than rely upon empirically derived constants based upon Palmer's original station inventory limited to the corn belt of the midwest United States. Calibration to the characteristics of the local climate is accomplished by correctly weighting the climatic characteristic, which affects the range of PDSI values, and the automatic calculation of the duration factors, which adjusts the sensitivity of the index. These two modifications cause the index to behave in a consistent, predictable manner as well as to more realistically represent the climates of diverse locations. (Wells, Goddard, and Hayes, 2004)\n",

Instead, the climatic characteristic is based solely on how the climate of the location, namely the range of its moisture departures, d, is related to the defined range of the PDSI. (Wells 2004)\n",
