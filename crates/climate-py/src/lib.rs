//! PyO3/NumPy bindings that expose `climate-core` as `climate_indices._native`.
//!
//! This is the only crate that knows about Python. It converts arrays and
//! errors at the boundary and holds no climate algorithm of its own; the
//! Python package decides when to call it and falls back to its pure-Python
//! implementation when the extension is not installed.

#[pymodule]
fn _native(m: &Bound<'_, PyModule>) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add("__version__", climate_core::VERSION)?;
    Ok(())
